# Advance PDF

## Introduction
The Advance PDF application allows users to process and extract information from PDF documents. It provides functionalities for text extraction, table recognition, and image handling through an intuitive interface.

## Technologies Used
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- Unstructured
- dotenv
- Uvicorn

## Features
- Upload PDF documents for processing.
- Extract structured and unstructured data from PDFs.
- Handle images and tables within PDF files.
- Real-time processing and feedback.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd advance_pdf
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file and add your API keys for any necessary services.

## How to Execute
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload
   ```
2. Access the application through your browser or API client.

## API Endpoints
- **POST** `/upload`: Upload a PDF document for processing.
- **GET** `/process`: Process the uploaded PDF and extract content.

## Frontend Components
- `HomePage`: The initial page where users can upload PDF documents.
- `PDFReview`: The interface for reviewing extracted content.

## Security Considerations
- API keys are handled securely and not stored on the client-side.
- User-specific data management ensures data isolation between different users.

## Future Improvements
1. Implement user authentication for enhanced security.
2. Integrate with additional data processing models for improved extraction.
3. Add multi-language support for PDF content extraction.
